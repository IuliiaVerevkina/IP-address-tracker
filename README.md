This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0).
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My task was to create this IP tracker app and keep it as close to design as possible. To get the locations of the IP addresses, I used the  [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) . I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create the map.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
